# Bearmaps18
Bearmaps project from CS61BL, 2018.

A* search algorithm implemented in src/main/java/GraphDB.java, rastering code implemented in src/main/java/Rasterer.java

## Goals:

The goal of the A* search algorithm was to find the shortest routes between two chosen locations in Berkeley.

The goal of the rastering code was to rescale and load the appropriate files based on the level of zoom and navigation input from a browser.

Being written in 2018, the webapp itself is unfortunately not fully functional, but there are configurable tests included in the src/test/java/ folder for evaluation purposes.
